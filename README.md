# Myriel

Myriel is a very minimum yet flexible blog boilerplate for [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com/).

## Prerequisite

- [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com/)
- Node.js and several modules which you can install with `npm install` at this
  root dir (Since I'm new to Go).

## Quickstart

[Install Hugo!](http://hugo.spf13.com/overview/quickstart) 

You need to clone this repo on your local machine.  

```
git clone git@github.com:studiomohawk/myriel.git
```

`cd` into your cloned repo.

Then, install node dependencies by 

`npm install`

### Run Hugo

```
hugo server -s . -w
```

or 

```
npm run start
```

Point your browser to <http://localhost:1313/>

And your running Hugo with Myriel theme!
